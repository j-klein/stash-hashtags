Stash plugin to support project hashtags. Hashtags are added to a project's
description. Projects may then be listed and searched by hashtag.

# Installation

From the administration console, go to 'Manage Add-ons' and select 'Upload
Add-on'. Upload the plugin .jar and restart Stash if necessary.

# User Guide

No configuration is required. Simply add hashtags to any project's description.
Valid hashtags consist of the # character followed by one or more word
characters. Hashtags are not case sensitive.

To browse projects by hashtag, select 'Hashtags' from the main navbar. You may
sort or search the table by project or hashtag. Projects are listed as a link
to the main project page.
